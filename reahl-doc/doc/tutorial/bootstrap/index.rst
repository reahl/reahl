Layout and styling using Bootstrap (experimental)
=================================================

.. sidebar:: Behind the scenes

   Reahl uses the `Bootstrap 4 framework <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ to deal
   with layout and styling issues.


In this version of Reahl, we introduce Widgets and Layouts that are
based on `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_\.

At the time of release of Reahl 3.2, Bootstrap version 4 was still in
alpha and under heavy development. For this reason, the bootstrap
support here is *not* enabled by default and is seen as experimental.

In Reahl 4.0, these Bootstrap versions of Widgets and Layouts will
become the only out-of-the-box styled Widgets supported -- our current
home-grown styled Widgets will disappear.

The experimental support for Bootstrap 4 is included here so that we
can gain experience with these ideas so long, and so that you can
start using them to see how they work.
