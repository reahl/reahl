Multilingual and multi-regional applications
============================================

.. sidebar:: Examples in this section

   - tutorial.i18nexamplebootstrap

   Get a copy of an example by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      reahl example <examplename>


The `tutorial.i18nexamplebootstrap` example changes :doc:`the simple
address book example <inputwidgets>` so that the user can select the
language displayed on the user interface. The chosen locale also
formats the display of dates.


Make your component translatable
--------------------------------


Add a |Nav| to choose a different locale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Behind the scenes

   Reahl uses the `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org//>`_
   internationalisation library to deal with translations and all other
   locale related customisations.

   Babel itself uses data regarding different locales that is derived
   from the `CLDR locale database <http://cldr.unicode.org/>`_.

Add a |Nav| containing all locales supported by your application to
the main |Navbar|. Call
:meth:`~reahl.web.bootstrap.navs.Nav.with_languages` to populate your
|Nav| with the available locales.

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/i18nexamplebootstrap.py
   :pyobject: AddressBookPage


Mark the messages that need to be translated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a global |Catalogue| in your module and assign it to the
variable name ``_`` (underscore):


.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/i18nexamplebootstrap.py
   :start-after: Declare a Catalogue for your component
   :end-before: class AddressBookPage

Wrap all strings destined for the user interface in a call to the
|Catalogue| similar to the brand text in AddressBookPage above.

Each ``_()`` call marks the relevant string so it can be found by
tools that search your source. These tools compile a catalogue of
strings that need translation. You will later add translated versions
for these messages in the same catalogue.

When creating the |Catalogue|, pass it the name of the catalogue
where it should search for translations to strings wrapped in ``_()``.
By convention the catalogue is named the same as your component.

The Address class contains more examples:

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/i18nexamplebootstrap.py
   :pyobject: Address


Dealing with plural messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some languages there are many distinct plural forms that differ
depending on the number of items you are talking about.

Use :meth:`~reahl.component.i18n.Catalogue.ngettext` for messages
that need plural translations. It takes the English singular and
plural form and returns the correct plural form for the target
language, given the number of items:

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/i18nexamplebootstrap.py
   :pyobject: AddressBookPanel


Other customisations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many other things can be customised depending on the chosen locale by
using the `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org//>`_ library directly. Obtain
the current locale string from ``_.current_locale``.

Format the date inside an AddressBox for the current locale:

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/i18nexamplebootstrap.py
   :pyobject: AddressBox


Making it possible for others to translate your component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the `i18nexamplebootstrapmessages` package in the top level directory of
the example (don't forget the __init__.py). It will house your message
catalogue. List it :ref:`as entry point in your setup.cfg<setup_cfg_schedule>`.
Also ensure that the relevant data files from that package will be included when
your package is built:

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/tutorial/i18nexamplebootstrap/setup.cfg
   :language: ini                     
   :start-after: [options.entry_points]
   :prepend:     [options.entry_points]

Once your "translations" package is ready, extract the catalogue from
your source code by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   reahl extractmessages

This stores your original messages inside
i18nexamplebootstrapmessages/i18nexamplebootstrap.


.. note::

   Remember to run ``python -m pip install --no-deps -e .`` after changing
   the `setup.cfg` file.



Add translated messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start translating messages to another language, add a
locale for it to the package housing all your translations.

Here we add the `af` locale (for the Afrikaans language) to
i18nexamplebootstrap by running (from the i18nexamplebootstrap
directory):

.. code-block:: bash

   reahl addlocale af i18nexamplebootstrap

This creates the file
`i18nexamplebootstrap/af/LC_MESSAGES/i18nexamplebootstrap.po` which
you must edit to supply the translated versions for the `af` locale.

Once done, compile the catalogue so that it can be used by a running
application:

.. code-block:: bash

   reahl compiletranslations


Supplying translations to another component
-------------------------------------------

A component can supply translations for use by another
component. First, make your component dependent on the one to which it
supplies translations.

Then, the process is exactly the same as before:
 - add a `<translations>` package in your component to hold the translated messages;
 - add the new locale to your new component, stating the catalogue name for which the locale is intended:

 .. code-block:: bash

    reahl addlocale fr theothercomponentcataloguename

 - translate the messages in the text file created; and
 - compile the messages as usual.

.. warning::

   If you add a locale that is not included by Reahl itself, you need
   to supply translations for all the Reahl components you use.




Updating translations
---------------------

When your software changes, the messages used in it also
change. Extract the new set of original messages as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

   reahl extractmessages

Then update your already-translated list of messages using the new list:

.. code-block:: bash

   reahl mergetranslations

Finally, edit the merged messages to supply translated versions of new
messages before compiling them as before.
