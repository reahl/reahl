Internationalisation
====================

.. sidebar:: Behind the scenes

   The Internationalisation infrastructure of Reahl is built using
   `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org//>`_.

Internationalisation in Reahl is based on locales. A "locale" defines
what natural language to use for user messages, and what other customs
are applicable for users choosing that locale (such as how dates and
numbers are formatted).

The example presented here contains a simple View containing a user
message that needs to be translated. At the top of the page, a Menu is
displayed listing all locales supported by the system.

In order to be able to illustrate how URLs influence the locale used,
the example does not have a home page. If you run the example locally,
you will have to open the View by using its URL:
http://localhost:8000/some_page.  When viewed via
http://localhost:8000/some_page the example program shows the string
in British English (the default):

   .. figure:: ../_build/screenshots/i18n1.png
      :alt: A screenshot with the message in English and a menu where the locale can be switched.


When the user clicks on "Afrikaans" in the Menu, the same page is
displayed in Afrikaans. Notice how the URL of the View has changed: it
now starts with "af" (the locale string for Afrikaans):

   .. figure:: ../_build/screenshots/i18n2.png
      :alt: A screenshot with the message in Afrikaans and a menu where the locale can be switched.


Embedding an identifier for the chosen locale in the URL of a View
means that a different URL will exist for each supported locale for a
View. This makes it possible for search engines to crawl and index all
localised versions of a View.

The code below shows how a HMenu is created that allows the user
to choose between supported locales. Also shown is how strings that
will be shown to a user are marked for translation by the
customary method of enclosing them in `_(...)`.  To make a callable `_`
available, a Translator instance needs to be instantiated (typically
at the top of each file). Note that the Translator instance is created
for the `reahl-doc` component -- the component in which the example
resides.

.. literalinclude:: ../../reahl/doc/examples/features/i18nexample/i18nexample.py


Translations of the user messages for a particular component have to
be prepared by humans (just like source code is) and compiled for use
in production. The `reahl` commandline tool includes commands that
help authors extract all the messages that are marked for translation
from the source code of a component, maintain these and finally
compile them for use.

A translation is also shipped inside a component -- any given component
may provide the translation of any number of other components, for any
number of locales. This makes it possible for anyone to add support
for a chosen locale to any component, even if the target component was
developed by someone else without any knowledge of the locale you want
to add support for.

All other internationalisation in Reahl is done using the facilities
directly provided by `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org//>`_.
