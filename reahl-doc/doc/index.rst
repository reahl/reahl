Reahl documentation
===================

Reahl comprises a number of projects that help with the development of
interactive web applications.

These projects were developed to support development of Reahl-web but can be
used without it too.

Reahl-web is a web application framework that allows a programmer to work
in terms of useful abstractions -- using a single programming language.

The details of how those abstractions are implemented using several
different web technologies are hidden and dealt with for the
programmer.
