    By default, all :py:class:`Fixture`\s are in 'function' scope,
    meaning they are created, set up, and torn down around each test
    function run. With `@scope` this default can be changed to
    'session' scope. A session scoped :py:class:`Fixture` is created
    and set up the first time it is entered as context manager, and
    torn down only once: when the test process exits.

    If the :py:class:`Fixture` contains multiple scenarios, a session
    scoped instance is created and set up for each scenario.

class WithFixtureDecorator:
    """A decorator for injecting :py:class:`Fixture`\s into pytest test method arguments.

    This decorator takes a list of :py:class:`Fixture` classes as
    arguments and ensures that the first declared positional arguments
    of the `test_` function it decorates will be populated with
    instances of the corresponding :py:class:`Fixture` classes when
    the test is run.

    The names of these positional arguments do not matter.

    If a :py:class:`Fixture` in this list has scenarios, the test
    function will be run repeatedly--once for each scenario. If more than
    one :py:class:`Fixture` in this list has scenarios, the `test_`
    function will be repeated once for each combination of scenarios.

    For example::

       class MyFixture(Fixture):
           def new_string(self):
               return 'this is a test'

       @with_fixtures(MyFixture)
       def test_this(my_fix)
           assert my_fix.string == 'this is a test'

    The use of :py:class:`Fixture` classes can me mixed with
    pytest.fixture functions. In such a case, the :py:class:`Fixture`
    instances are passed to the first declared positional arguments of
    the test function, leaving the remainder of the arguments to be
    interpreted by pytest itself::

       class MyFixture(Fixture):
           def new_string(self):
               return 'this is a test'

       class MyOtherFixture(Fixture):
           def new_int(self):
               return 123

       @pytest.fixture
       def another_string():
           return 'another'

       @with_fixtures(MyFixture, MyOtherFixture)
       def test_this(my_fix, other, another_string)
           assert my_fix.string == 'this is a test'
           assert other.int == 123
           assert another_string == 'another'
