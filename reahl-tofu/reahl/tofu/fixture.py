class Fixture:
    """A test Fixture is a collection of objects defined and set up to be
       used together in a test. 

       A Fixture can be used by many tests and also by other Fixtures.


       To create your own Fixture, create a subclasses of Fixture.
       On such a subclass, a new member of the Fixture is defined by a specially
       named method that is able to create the object.
       
       The name of such a 'factory method' is `new_` with the name of the object
       appended.

       .. code-block:: python

          class MyFixture(Fixture):
              def new_name(self):
                  return 'myname'

       A Fixture is used inside a with statement or as using a plugin for a test
       framework.

       A member of the Fixture can be accessed by referencing it by
       name on the fixture as if it were an attribute.

       The first time a program references a member on the Fixture
       instance, the corresponding `new_` method will be called behind
       the scenes (without arguments) to create the object. Subsequent
       accesses of the same member will always bring back the same
       instance which was created on the first access.

       .. code-block:: python

          with MyFixture() as fixture:
               assert fixture.name is fixture.name

       If the created singleton object also needs to be torn down, the new\_ method
       should yield it (not return), and perform necessary tear down after the yield
       statement.

       Singletons are torn down using this mechanism in reverse order
       of how they were created. (The last one created is torn down
       first.) Singleton instances are also torn down before any other
       tear down logic happens (because, presumably the instances are
       all created after all other setup occurs).

       A Fixture instance can be used as a context manager. It is set up before 
       entering the block of code it manages, and torn down upon exiting it.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.2
          Added support for `del_` methods.

       .. versionchanged:: 4.0 
          Changed to work with pytest instead of nosetests
          (:py:class:`with_fixtures`, :py:func:`scope`,
          :py:func:`uses`).

       .. versionchanged:: 4.0 
          Removed `.run_fixture` and `.context`.

       .. versionchanged:: 4.0 
          Removed `_del` methods in favour of allowing `new_` methods to yield, then tear down.
