"""Tofu is a collection of test utilities, some of which are
integrated to work as a plugin with `pytest
<http://docs.pytest.org>`_.

The main feature of Tofu is its ability to let you write
of test :py:class:`Fixture` classes, each of which contains a
collection of related objects used in a test.

Tofu also gobbled up another little test project, called `tut` which
implemented a few utilities for testing exceptions, dealing with
temporary files, etc. All this functionality is now also part of Tofu.
