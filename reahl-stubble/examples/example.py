# (see also acceptance/DelegationTests.py)

# calling s.foo, the real foo is called, which
# sets 'aa' on the stub, even though the setting of
# 'aa' happens in real code.

    #this expected behaviour is would have been tested
    # like this:

#but alas, we cannot do that...
#
# This problem severely limits the use of Delegates and can

# careful!

#==================================================[ InstanceVariables ]
# (see also acceptance/InstanceVariablesTests.py)

#  and that the code above would complain, you're in for a surprise...

#----------------------------------------[ using the class attributes convention ]
