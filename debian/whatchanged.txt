 * Split the login functionality out of UserSession to LoginSession (Blueprint: login-session-split).
   UserSession.<methods related to logging in and out> no longer exist.
   LoginSession now exists (elsewhere) and has those, and is used differently.
   reahl-interfaces does not exist anymore, and UserSessionProtocol & WebUserSessionProtocol have been merged into the latter
   There is no WebUserSession anymore.
   Database migration??
   Dependencies between components have changed: domain is now dependent on web-declarative, not the other way around.
   The Implication of this is that domain stuff cannot be used except in "the web"

   Config settings moved from config.accounts.* (systemaccountmodel.config.py) config.web.* (in web.config.py)
    session_lifetime
    idle_lifetime
    idle_lifetime_max
    idle_secure_lifetime

 * Removed reahl-tofu dependency on nose and on reahl-component.
   Installing reahl-tofu does not automatically pull in nose anymore.
   reahl-{tofu,stubble} can be used without any other reahl stuff.
