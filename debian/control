Package: python-reahl
Architecture: all
Depends: python-setuptools, ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: The Reahl web framework.
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 The details of how those abstractions are implemented using several 
 different web technologies are hidden and dealt with for the programmer.

Package: python-reahl-component
Architecture: all
Depends: python-setuptools, ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: The component framework of Reahl.
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Reahl-component is the component that contains Reahl's component framework.

Package: python-reahl-dev

Package: python-reahl-bzrsupport
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Distutils support for Bazaar when using Reahl development tools.

 version control system.

Package: python-reahl-stubble
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Stub tools for use in unit testing
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Stubble (a part of the Reahl development tools) is a collection of
 tools for writing stubs in unit tests.
 .
 Using stubs allows one to decouple one unit test from real code 
 unrelated to it - you write a fake class to take the place of 
 a real one (which this test is not testing).
 .
 Stubble ensures, however, that the test will break should the
 interface of the stub differ from that of the real class it is a stub
 for.

Package: python-reahl-tofu
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: A testing framework that couples fixtures and tests loosely.
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Tofu is a plugin for nosetests, and part of the Reahl development tools.
 .
 Tofu allows you to have
 a hierarchy of test fixtures that is *completely* decoupled from your
 hierarchy of tests or test suites. Tofu includes a number of other
 related test utilities.
 .
 Tofu can also be used to run the set_ups of fixtures from the command 
 line.  This is useful for acceptance tests whose fixtures create data
 in databases that can be used for demonstration and user testing.

Description: Simple utilities for sending email from Reahl.
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Reahl-mailutil is a simple library for sending emails (optionally from ReST 
 sources).
