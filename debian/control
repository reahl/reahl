Architecture: all

Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: The Reahl web framework.
 Reahl is a web application framework for Python programmers.
 .
 With Reahl, programming is done purely in Python, using concepts familiar 
 from GUI programming---like reusable Widgets and Events. There's no need 
 for a programmer to know several different languages (HTML, JavaScript, 
 template languages, etc) or to keep up with the tricks of these trades. The 
 abstractions presented by Reahl relieve the programmer from the burden 
 of dealing with the annoying problems of the web: security, accessibility, 
 progressive enhancement (or graceful degradation) and browser quirks.
 .
 Reahl consists of many different eggs that are not all needed all of the time. 
 This package does not contain much itself, but is an entry point for installing
 a set of Reahl eggs:
 .
 Install Reahl by installing with extras, eg: pip install "reahl[declarative,sqlite,dev,doc]"
 to install everything needed to run Reahl on sqlite, the dev tools and documentation.
 (On Windows platforms, use easy_install instead of pip.)
 .
 See http://www.reahl.org/docs/4.0/tutorial/gettingstarted-install.d.html for
 installation instructions.

Package: python-reahl-stubble
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Stub tools for use in unit testing
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Stubble (a part of the Reahl development tools) is a collection of
 tools for writing stubs in unit tests. Stubble can be used independently
 of the Reahl web framework.
 .
 Using stubs allows one to decouple one unit test from real code 
 unrelated to it - you write a fake class to take the place of 
 a real one (which this test is not testing).
 .
 Stubble ensures, however, that the test will break should the
 interface of the stub differ from that of the real class it is a stub
 for.

Package: python-reahl-tofu
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${reahl:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: A testing framework that couples fixtures and tests loosely.
 Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in 
 terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.
 .
 Tofu is part of the Reahl development tools.
 Tofu can be used independently of the Reahl web framework.
 .
 Tofu allows you to have
 a hierarchy of test fixtures that is *completely* decoupled from your
 hierarchy of tests or test suites. Tofu includes a number of other
 related test utilities. It also includes a plugin for nosetests
 that makes using it with nose seamless.
 .
 Tofu can also be used to run the set_ups of fixtures from the command 
 line.  This is useful for acceptance tests whose fixtures create data
 in databases that can be used for demonstration and user testing.
