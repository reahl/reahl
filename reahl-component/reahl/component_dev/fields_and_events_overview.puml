title Fields and Events 

note as N1
  A Field controls the attribute of a model object.
  A Field can have ValidationConstraints and AccessRights. 
  An Event is a kind of Field representing something the user can trigger.
  Events are made to do something by linking them to Actions.
  Actions wrap a python callable
  AccessRights are linked to an Action to determine whether a 
  Field is writeable and another to determine if it is readable.
