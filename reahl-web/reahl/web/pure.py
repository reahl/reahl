    """Represents a set of relative sizes to be used for an element depending 
       on the size of the user's device, as defined by the Pure library.

       The Pure library sizes elements relative to their parent using
       fractions (1/2 or 3/4 or 1 are examples).  The size of an
       element relative to its parent can also vary, depending on the
       size of the device a user is using to view your web
       application.

       This class lets one specify the size to use for different sizes of
       display device.

       Sizes should be given as fractions in strings, such as the literal:

       .. code-block:: python

          UnitSize(sm='1', md='1/2', xl='1/4')

       Sizes can be given for sizes of device using the keyword arguments:

       :keyword default: If no other size is specified, or if the screen being used is smaller than the sizes given, this size is used.
       :keyword sm: For small screens (or larger).
       :keyword md: For medium-sized screen (or larger).
       :keyword lg: For large devices (or larger).
       :keyword xl: For extra-large devices (or larger).

       .. note::

          If a size is specified for `md`, for example, it will be used
          on all screens that are medium-sized or larger and Pure will fall
          back to using the `default` size for smaller screens.
